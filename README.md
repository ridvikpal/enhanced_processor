## IT IS AN ACADEMIC OFFENSE TO COPY CODE. THIS IS SIMPLY FOR REFERENCE
Working Code for ECE243 Lab 8 (Winter 2023) at the University of Toronto. The main code is in Verilog and can be simulated in Modelsim. The goal is to extend the simple processor from lab 7 to support all of the following instructions:

These instructions can be loaded into a .mif file with the help of the provided (created by Professor Jonathon Rose) sbasm.py python compiler script that will input a .s file and write to a .mif file. The processor reads the instructions to execute from the .mif file. Please see the attached PDF for more information. A schematic of how the enhanced processor works is as follows:
